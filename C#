C#

This one seems to be a programming language that actually has more in common with Java than it does C++.

From the Software Guild website https://www.thesoftwareguild.com/faq/difference-between-c-plus-plus-and-c-sharp/

"it is a widely used coding language that allows software developers to create secure and user-friendly 
applications that run on the .NET Framework. C# is used to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, 
distributed components, client-server, database applications and more."

C# gets a lot of usage on the Windows side of things. It is highly object-oriented, and gets rid of the manual
memory management that other C languages have. Overall it is less powerful that C/C++ but is oftentimes
easier to work with.
